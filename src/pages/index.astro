    information={`My name is Ricardo Lopes, and I'm from Portugal.
                  Thank you for visiting my podcast.
                  Over the past few years, I have conducted and released more than 800 interviews and talks with experts and academics from a variety of areas and disciplines, ranging from the Arts and Philosophy to the Social Sciences and Biology.
                  You will certainly find a subject of your interest covered here. New interviews are released on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays.
