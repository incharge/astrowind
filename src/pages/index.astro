    information={`My name is Ricardo Lopes, and I'm from Portugal.
                  Thank you for visiting my podcast.
                  Over the past few years, I have conducted and released more than 800 interviews and talks with experts and academics from a variety of areas and disciplines, ranging from the Arts and Philosophy to the Social Sciences and Biology.
                  You will certainly find a subject of your interest covered here. New interviews are released on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays.

        text: "I was very impressed with Ricardo’s penetrating style of conversation. It was more a conversation--an engaging, spontaneous, and free-ranging conversation--than a standard interview, and only the most well-prepared of questioners can bring this off so naturally. His expertise was all the more impressive considering that, in order to interview me, he was stepping out of his normal intellectual terrain—science—and into philosophy.",

I am impressed that Ricardo can manage to achieve this level of informed preparation on such a wide variety of topics.",

        text: "Ricardo Lopes’ form of dissent is his opposition to vacuous, disjointed, evasive or mindless interviews.   He is a journalist-intellectual who comes fully prepared to his interviews, conversant in the relevant literature, aware of the central points of controversy and systematic in his deep and pointed questioning.   The result is the production of very substantive conversations - monuments of a sort to the life of the mind.",
